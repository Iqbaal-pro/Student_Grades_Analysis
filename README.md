# Student Grades Analysis

This project analyzes student scores using Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, visualization, and Machine Learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Process and clean student grade data
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, top scores)
- Rank students based on their performance
- Visualize score distributions per subject
- Predict Mathematics scores using Linear Regression based on student averages
- Query data using SQL for advanced analysis

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **SQLite3**: SQL queries on data  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
